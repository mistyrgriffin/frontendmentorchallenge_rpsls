## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by watching YouTube tutorials and researching codes on Google. I am particularly excited about learning how to embed HTML code using JavaScript commands. Another exciting skill I learned was how to use "Local Storage" to contain information for later use.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to practice CSS Grid and Flexbox to become more comfortable with positioning and aligning elements on the page. I also plan to continue developing my skills in CSS and JavaScript to build muscle memory and become more fluent in my use of the coding languages.
